# Random Text Generator

> Xcode 14.2, iOS 16+

## Tech used

- SwiftUI

## Logic implemented

- A user can generate some text with a button. Generated text consists of alphanumeric characters, separated with spaces only (for simplicity). 
- This text varies in length with a default bounds of 1 to 100 words. Word length varies with default bounds of 1 to 15 characters.
- A user can see the generated text word count
- A user can edit the text, word count will update accordingly

## Misc

- Added unit tests for generator
